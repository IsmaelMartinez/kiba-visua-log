# Contributing

Thanks for reading this document and thinking about contributing.

I tried to make it as easy as possible.

Create a PR. Once the PR is approved, I will ask to change the version number in setup.py. 

Once that is done, I will merge. That will trigger a release.

Any questions, just drop me an email or write an issue. 

Thanks again and happy contributing!!
